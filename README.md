# ðŸ§¬ Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project uses the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using various classification algorithms, with a focus on **Random Forest**.


## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- Applied preprocessing and feature scaling to clean the dataset.
- Built and compared models including:
  - Random Forest Classifier âœ…
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
- Evaluated models using metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)


## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook


## ðŸ“Š Model Performance

The **Random Forest** classifier achieved:
- Accuracy: **~96%**
- High recall for malignant cases
- Good generalization across test data
